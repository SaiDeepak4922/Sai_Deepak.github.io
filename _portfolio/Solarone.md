The Westervelt group spent two days at the Solar One Environmental Education Center, collaborating on an air sensor research project. As part of the project, New York City area high school teachers and students were involved in air quality research, and we kicked off these efforts with a 2-day training on air quality including a custom-built "make your own air sensor" session in which teachers worked with materials provided by the group to assemble and connect to the internet their own air sensors. These sensors will be placed in area schools where existing air monitoring is scarce, and will feed into the Westervelt group research efforts. Below are some of the pictures showing Dr. Westervelt, Dr. Sathish Swaminathan and myself interacting with the teachers.
