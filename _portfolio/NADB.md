The NADB (North American Development Bank) - EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) funded project aimed to empower the younger generations with knowledge of air quality and associated health impacts. The team consisted of Dr. Amit Raysoni (PI of the project), Dr. Owen Temby (Co-I), Dr. Dawid Wladyka (Co-I), and myself. We installed a total of 17 low-cost sensors in the outdoor environments of different schools and provided the schools with air quality data that they had never had access to before. I prepared the educational curriculum to train more than 1400 students of all levels. Fact sheets and informational flyers were also prepared and distributed to all the students by the team, to increase their knowledge about air pollution and negative health impacts. Below are some of the pictures during one of those activities at Math and Science Academy of UTRGV.
