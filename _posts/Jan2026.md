Fall 2025 has been excellent start to the Ph.D. program at Columbia University. As part of the course requirements, I took 3 courses that were really helpful. And in the research aspect, significant progress have been made. During my stay at UTRGV, I first-authored couple of manuscripts that were submitted this semester. While one of them got accepted into Atmospheric Environemnt:X(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeaoa.2025.100405), another manuscript is currently under review with Environmental Research Communications. 
As part of the Columbia Global funded Queens project, we were able to collect air quality data of Queens from 2000 - present to conduct preliminary analysis. The educational outreach activities as part of the project also started(https://saideepak4922.github.io/Sai_Deepak.github.io//portfolio/Solarone/). 

Spring 2026 is going to be an exciting one. Our research projects were selected for presentations at ASIC 2026 and the Workshop on Ultrafine Particles: Classification, Characterization, and Instrument Performance Requirements.
