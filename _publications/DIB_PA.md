Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is one of the criteria air pollutants associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health effects. This dataset contains hourly and daily averaged measurements of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (μg/m<sup>3</sup>) collected from two residential homes in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Region of South Texas, using PurpleAir-II-SD low-cost sensor. In addition, the dataset also includes temperature (ºC) and relative humidity (%) measured by the sensors. The data was collected for one month during the summer season from indoor (kitchen) and outdoor (front yard) environments at two locations: Home-1 in Weslaco City from June 16, 2024, to July 16, 2024, and Home-2 in Mission City from June 22, 2024, to July 16, 2024. Furthermore, the resultant wind speed and wind direction data were obtained from nearby Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Continuous Ambient Monitoring Station (CAMS) site, providing a better understanding of meteorological influences on air quality.
The raw PM<sub>2.5</sub> data were corrected using Barkjohn's US-wide correction equation to increase the accuracy of the measurements and are presented in the datasets. The dataset is available in three CSV files: one for Home-1, one for Home-2, and one for wind data (Wind Rose) from the TCEQ stations. This dataset has significant potential for reuse by researchers interested in air quality monitoring, exposure assessment, and the health impacts of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Furthermore, the study highlights the effectiveness of using low-cost sensors for continuous air quality monitoring in residential settings, thereby contributing to the growing body of air quality literature emanating from the U.S.-Mexico border region.
