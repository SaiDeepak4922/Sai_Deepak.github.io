This pilot study focuses on particulate matter (PM) while cooking in a South Texan household. Dishes such as Beef, Burger, Fish, Chicken, Egg Sandwich, and Hotdog were prepared. Indoor PM levels were compared with outdoor PM levels. A DustTrak DRX was used to monitor the PM released during the cooking process. PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were highest while cooking beef, 162.79 + 209.62 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. Hot Dog preparation resulted in the lowest PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of 27.72 + 5.58 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. Indoor PM2.5 levels were observed to be greater in contrast to outdoor levels when compared to the outdoor levels.
