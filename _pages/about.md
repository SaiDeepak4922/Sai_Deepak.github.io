I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. I am being advised by [Dr. Daniel M Westervelt] (https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~danielmw/), the Principal Investigator of [Westervelt Aerosol Group] (https://aerosol.ldeo.columbia.edu/). My research focuses on air quality, atmospheric aerosols, satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and environmental exposure disparities. I am especially intereseted in ground-based air sensors and satellite Aerosol optical depth products to understand the sources and trends of particulate matter. 

My work integrates ground-based observations from air sensor networks, regulatory monitoring data, and satellite and reanalysis products to characterize particulate pollution and its sources. I am also interested in understanding the accuracy of air sensors in measuring  and their accuracy in measuring particulate and gaseous pollutants. I am currently involved in multiple projects: [Air quality monitoring in Queens] (https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/clean-air-monitoring-interventions-empowering-communities-severely-under-monitored-sections-queens); Size-resolved Performance Evaluation and Correction Factor Development for 10 Consumer-Grade Air Sensors in New York; Monitoring Ultrafine, Fine, and Coarse Particles Along with Gaseous Pollutants Using Modulair Sensors at a major highway in New York City. 

Previously, I earned a Master's degree in Agricultural, Environmental and Sustainability Sciences from [The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley] (https://www.utrgv.edu/) where I worked as Graduate Research Assistant and Graduate Teaching Assistant. My thesis work at UTRGV focused on understanding the impacts of stubble burning on local air quality, utilizing data from ground-based air quality monitoring stations and satellite remote sensing. Apart from the theis work, I also contributed to multiple other projects involving air quality monitoring in the Rio Grande Valley region.
